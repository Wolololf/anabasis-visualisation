Anabasis visualisation:

First pass:
- Map out the path
- Show key events (e.g. battles, negotiations) and places

Second pass:
- Tie together locations and time
- Reveal path over time using slider
- Show detailed information when hovering/clicking on path/event

Polish:
- Track remaining troop numbers at events/time
- Only show new cities and events when "found"
- Interpolate path between two tracked points
- Bibliography references

Implementation:
- Data definition:
	- Latitude + longitude
	- DateTime
	- Event type
	- Event name
	- Details
	- Troop count
	- Bibliography

- Data collection
	- CSV format, e.g. using google sheets
	- Latitude+longitude data based on research paper, web search and some guesswork with google maps
	- Time stamps from research paper
	- Troop count estimates and bibliography references from source material

- Map creation:
	- Jupyter lab
	- Geopandas for geospatial data, with a time column
	- Map visualisation with contextily, cartopy or other
	- Combined visualisation with plotly? Or matplotlib+shapely with contextily/cartopy?
		- I think I'll want to use multiple libraries for more control?
