TODO:
- Show current date based on start day
- Custom markers per event type
- Only show new cities and events when "found"
- Interpolate path between two tracked points
- Don't show/hover points that are purely for path accuracy, not events
- Track remaining troop numbers at events/time
- Bibliography references
- Support alternative routes and starting dates

- Data collection
	- CSV format, e.g. using google sheets
	- Latitude+longitude data based on research paper, web search and some guesswork with google maps
	- Time stamps from research paper
	- Troop count estimates and bibliography references from source material
