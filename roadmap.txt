Anabasis visualisation:

TODO:
- Custom markers per event type
- Don't show/hover points that are purely for path accuracy, not events
- Track remaining troop numbers at events/time
- Bibliography references
- Support alternative routes and starting dates

Bugs:
- Slider jitters in and out of view, progress snaps back and forth
- If start and end date are equal, only show one?

- Data collection
	- CSV format, e.g. using google sheets
	- Latitude+longitude data based on research paper, web search and some guesswork with google maps
	- Time stamps from research paper
	- Troop count estimates and bibliography references from source material
